# Automating the configuration of SSH on Kali Linux can be done using a Bash script. 
# Here's a simple example of a Bash script, 
# that automates the process of configuring SSH on Kali Linux:

# <-- Script Starts From Here --->
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the script is run as root
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Please run this script as root."
  exit 1
fi

# Install SSH server if not already installed
if ! dpkg -l | grep -q "openssh-server"; then
  echo "Installing OpenSSH Server..."
  apt-get update
  apt-get install -y openssh-server
fi

# Enable and start the SSH service
systemctl enable ssh
systemctl start ssh

# Configure SSH settings (you can customize these as needed)
echo "Configuring SSH..."
echo "PermitRootLogin prohibit-password" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
echo "PasswordAuthentication yes" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
echo "AllowUsers your_username" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Reload SSH service to apply changes
systemctl reload ssh

# Display SSH status
systemctl status ssh

echo "SSH configuration is complete."

# <-- Script Ends Here --->

#Note: -
#  - Before running the script, make sure to:
#      - Make the script executable: chmod +x configure_ssh.sh
#      - Run it as root: sudo ./configure_ssh.sh

#This script does the following:
#  Checks if it's being run as root.
#  Installs the OpenSSH Server package if it's not already installed.
#  Enables and starts the SSH service.
#  Configures SSH settings by appending specific lines to the sshd_config file. You can customize these settings according to your needs.
#  Reloads the SSH service to apply the changes.
#  Displays the status of the SSH service.
  
# Make sure to customize the script to fit your specific requirements, 
# such as changing the SSH settings, 
# specifying allowed users, and setting security options. 
# Always be cautious when automating configuration changes on a system, 
# especially regarding SSH, as it can impact system security.
