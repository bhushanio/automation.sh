# Automating the configuration of SSH on Kali Linux can be done using a Bash script. 
# Here's a simple example of a Bash script, 
# that automates the process of configuring SSH on Kali Linux:

#!/bin/bash

# Check if the script is run as root
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Please run this script as root."
  exit 1
fi

# Install SSH server if not already installed
if ! dpkg -l | grep -q "openssh-server"; then
  echo "Installing OpenSSH Server..."
  apt-get update
  apt-get install -y openssh-server
fi

# Enable and start the SSH service
systemctl enable ssh
systemctl start ssh

# Configure SSH settings (you can customize these as needed)
echo "Configuring SSH..."
echo "PermitRootLogin prohibit-password" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
echo "PasswordAuthentication yes" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
echo "AllowUsers your_username" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Reload SSH service to apply changes
systemctl reload ssh

# Display SSH status
systemctl status ssh

echo "SSH configuration is complete."
